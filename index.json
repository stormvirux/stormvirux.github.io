This paper proposes a hierarchical clustered dynamic source routing (HCDSR) technique to improve fault tolerance and energy-efficient routing for WSNs. A survey of fault tolerant and energy-efficient routing techniques for WSNs is given. A taxonomy of fault tolerant techniques is introduced. The proposed HCDSR is simulated and compared with LEACH (low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) and DFTR (dynamic fault tolerant routing) protocols to evaluate its performance. The results show that HCDSR outperforms LEACH and DFTR in terms of the total network energy, the number of nodes alive after a given time, and the network throughput.

Developers often use various development technologies when developing web or cloud applications. One of such major technologies is web frameworks (e.g., Rails, Spring, Django, and CodeIgniter), which permit developers to develop without worrying about the low-level details. Programmers may choose from a variety of web frameworks, and different languages that support them, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Organizations work in different application domains and have diverse priorities and constraints with regard to the development of applications and services. In this paper, we propose an automatic tool, SelecWeb, for selecting a web framework based on a set of criteria and developer preferences. The set of selection criteria is developed by us and is a contribution of this paper. The tool currently uses analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for comparison, analysis, and decision-making. We provide a detailed description and analysis of the tool including a case study for web framework selection.

They play a significant role in solving linear system of equations using iterative methods. Sparse Kernels are computational operations on matrices whose entries are mostly zero so that computations with and storage of these zero elements may be eliminated. The emergence of parallel architectures, especially GPU, while offering higher computational performance, has led to the redesign of existing algorithms to suit the architecture. Specialized storage structures are used to improve the performance of sparse SpMV. These structures have design issues for translating it to GPUs. Special SpMV must be designed using these structures to improve the performance on GPUs.\nImplementation of parallel iterative solvers on GPU has numerous issues. Specialized storage structures are used to improve the performance of sparse SpMV. These structures have design issues for translating it to GPUs. The problems faced in implementing parallel sparse iterative solvers and converting sparse structures to GPU is as listed below:\n Coalesced memory access to both the sparse matrix A and the vector y Load balance among array threads and warps Thread divergence among a warp of threads. Performance variance based on the structure of the sparse matrices The amount of memory access required for computations.  Depending upon the sparsity of the structure the performance of the matrices vary and issues such as coalesced memory access, load balancing among threads, and thread divergence are dependent upon the sparsity structure of the matrices. The sparse storage schemes that satisfy the above conditions does not necessarily satisfy these conditions for other matrices and hence there is a performance deterioration. The sparsity structure of the sparse matrices varies from matrix to matrix, and application domain to domain. The performance of the SpMV kernel is dependent upon the sparsity structure of the matrices. We can deduce that none of the sparse representation schemes are perpetually superior rather the SpMV performance depends upon the sparse representation and the choice of sparse representation is based on the sparsity structure. The GPU architecture used for SpMV computations and the thread-block-warp configuration of the SpMV kernel are two other factors that affect the performance of SpMV kernel on GPUs.\nIn this research, we propose a new adaptive schemes and techniques that dynamically uses the best possible storage format that gives the maximum performance depending upon the sparsity structure of the matrices. The idea is to have sparse storage scheme that dynamically satisfies load balancing, and coalesced memory access without thread divergence.\n","date":1565774276,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577393100,"objectID":"3ccbb52e8c707a6386c359484c682737","permalink":"https://users.aalto.fi/~mohammt1/project/spmv/","publishdate":"2019-08-14T12:17:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/~mohammt1/project/spmv/","section":"project","summary":"Adaptive techniques for sparse storage and multiplication","tags":["HPC","SpMV"],"title":"Novel Techniques for Large Sparse Linear Equation Systems","type":"project"},{"authors":["Thaha Muhammed","Rashid Mehmood","Aiiad Albeshri","Iyad Katib"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577393100,"objectID":"6a4b06e8b4a5fa161fbd68010bd5bb75","permalink":"https://users.aalto.fi/~mohammt1/publication/mmak-19/","publishdate":"2019-08-12T13:51:35.850947Z","relpermalink":"/~mohammt1/publication/mmak-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Sparse matrix-vector (SpMV) multiplication is a vital building block for numerous scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes SURAA (translates to speed in arabic), a novel method for SpMV computations on graphics processing units (GPUs). The novelty lies in the way we group matrix rows into different segments, and adaptively schedule various segments to different types of kernels. The sparse matrix data structure is created by sorting the rows of the matrix on the basis of the nonzero elements per row (npr) and forming segments of equal size (containing approximately an equal number of nonzero elements per row) using the Freedman\u0026ndash;Diaconis rule. The segments are assembled into three groups based on the mean npr of the segments. For each group, we use multiple kernels to execute the group segments on different streams. Hence, the number of threads to execute each segment is adaptively chosen. Dynamic Parallelism available in Nvidia GPUs is utilized to execute the group containing segments with the largest mean npr, providing improved load balancing and coalesced memory access, and hence more efficient SpMV computations on GPUs. Therefore, SURAA minimizes the adverse effects of the npr variance by uniformly distributing the load using equal sized segments. We implement the SURAA method as a tool and compare its performance with the de facto best commercial (cuSPARSE) and open source (CUSP, MAGMA) tools using widely used benchmarks comprising 26 high npr-variance matrices from 13 diverse domains. SURAA outperforms the other tools by delivering 13.99x speedup on average. We believe that our approach provides a fundamental shift in addressing SpMV related challenges on GPUs including coalesced memory access, thread divergence, and load balancing, and is set to open new avenues for further improving SpMV performance in the future.","tags":["SpMV","HPC","GPU","iterative methods","analysis","sparse matrix storage","load balancing","coalesced access"],"title":"SURAA: A Novel Method and Tool for Loadbalanced and Coalesced SpMV Computations on GPUs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thaha Muhammed","Rashid Mehmood","Aiiad Albeshri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577393100,"objectID":"91aa9a754f388a18e7a9bee48a9e86b1","permalink":"https://users.aalto.fi/~mohammt1/publication/mma-17/","publishdate":"2019-08-12T13:51:35.849231Z","relpermalink":"/~mohammt1/publication/mma-17/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a revolutionary technology that has become an integral part of smart cities.

Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework.
