  abstract  = {Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a key technology which is used in many safety critical applications. The sensors in wireless sensor network have to be deployed in hostile, harsh and unattended environments for long periods of time. This creates a great challenge in providing a good quality of service. This results in introductions of faults, sensor failures, communication failures and changes in topology. Hence, efficient fault detection techniques are required for good quality of service. In this article, we survey various fault detection techniques and provide a new taxonomy to integrate new fault detection techniques. We perform a qualitative comparison of the latest fault detection algorithms. From a qualitative analysis, we select a list of techniques that are analyzed quantitatively. We also discuss the shortcomings, advantages and future research directions for fault detection in wireless sensor networks.},

  abstract  = {Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a revolutionary technology that has become an integral part of smart cities. It has numerous, longstanding, economical and safety-critical smart city applications. Data acquisition for IoT applications requires sensor networks. Reliability, Resilience, and Energy conservation are the three most critical wireless sensor requirements. Fault tolerance ensures the reliability and the resilience of the sensor network in case of failures. In this paper, we propose a new taxonomy for fault tolerant technique for wireless sensor networks deployed in an IoT environment, and qualitatively compare some major existing methods and propose a new fault-tolerant routing technique for hierarchical sensor networks. The algorithm is a heterogeneous technique based on Dynamic source routing (DSR), vice cluster heads, energy thresholding and hierarchical sensor networks. The proposed technique was simulated and is compared with current techniques to evaluate its validity and performance.},

  abstract  = {Sparse matrix-vector (SpMV) multiplication is a vital building block for numerous scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes SURAA (translates to speed in arabic), a novel method for SpMV computations on graphics processing units (GPUs). The novelty lies in the way we group matrix rows into different segments, and adaptively schedule various segments to different types of kernels. The sparse matrix data structure is created by sorting the rows of the matrix on the basis of the nonzero elements per row (   n p r) and forming segments of equal size (containing approximately an equal number of nonzero elements per row) using the Freedman&ndash;Diaconis rule. The segments are assembled into three groups based on the mean     n p r     of the segments. For each group, we use multiple kernels to execute the group segments on different streams. Hence, the number of threads to execute each segment is adaptively chosen. Dynamic Parallelism available in Nvidia GPUs is utilized to execute the group containing segments with the largest mean     n p r, providing improved load balancing and coalesced memory access, and hence more efficient SpMV computations on GPUs. Therefore, SURAA minimizes the adverse effects of the     n p r     variance by uniformly distributing the load using equal sized segments. We implement the SURAA method as a tool and compare its performance with the de facto best commercial (cuSPARSE) and open source (CUSP, MAGMA) tools using widely used benchmarks comprising 26 high     n p r  v a r i a n c e     matrices from 13 diverse domains. SURAA outperforms the other tools by delivering 13.99x speedup on average. We believe that our approach provides a fundamental shift in addressing SpMV related challenges on GPUs including coalesced memory access, thread divergence, and load balancing, and is set to open new avenues for further improving SpMV performance in the future.},

  abstract  = {The massive parallelism provided by the graphics processing units (GPUs) offers tremendous performance in many high-performance computing applications. One such application is Sparse Matrix-Vector (SpMV) multiplication, which is an essential building block for numerous scientific and engineering applications. Researchers who propose new storage techniques for sparse matrix-vector multiplication focus mainly on a single evaluation metrics or performance characteristics which is usually the throughput performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication in FLOPS. However, such an evaluation does not provide a deeper insight nor allow to compare new SpMV techniques with their competitors directly. In this chapter, we explain the notable performance characteristics of the GPU architectures and SpMV computations. We discuss various strategies to improve the performance of SpMV on GPUs. We also discuss a few performance criteria that are usually overlooked by the researchers during the evaluation process. We also analyze various well-known schemes such as COO, CSR, ELL, DIA, HYB, and CSR5 using the discussed performance characteristics.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing all spheres of our lives leading the way for us to evolve into smarter societies. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an integral part of the IoT ecosystems. Reliability, resilience, and energy conservation are the three most critical WSN requirements. Fault tolerance ensures the reliability and the resilience of WSNs in case of failures. This paper proposes a hierarchical clustered dynamic source routing (HCDSR) technique to improve fault tolerance and energy-efficient routing for WSNs. A survey of fault tolerant and energy-efficient routing techniques for WSNs is given. A taxonomy of fault tolerant techniques is introduced. The proposed HCDSR is simulated and compared with LEACH (low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) and DFTR (dynamic fault tolerant routing) protocols to evaluate its performance. The results show that HCDSR outperforms LEACH and DFTR in terms of the total network energy, the number of nodes alive after a given time, and the network throughput. Directions for future work are given.},

HPC enables large-scale simulations and processing of big data related to smart societies to optimize their services. Driving high efficiency from shared-memory and distributed HPC systems have always been challenging; it has become essential as we move towards the exascale computing era. Therefore, the evaluation, analysis, and optimization of HPC applications and systems to improve HPC performance on various platforms are of paramount importance. This paper reviews the performance analysis tools and techniques for HPC applications and systems. Common HPC applications used by the researchers and HPC benchmarking suites are discussed.

  abstract  = {Web applications and services are fundamental to designing smart infrastructure and cities. Developers often use various development technologies when developing web or cloud applications. One of such major technologies is web frameworks (e.g., Rails, Spring, Django, and CodeIgniter), which permit developers to develop without worrying about the low-level details. Programmers may choose from a variety of web frameworks, and different languages that support them, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Organizations work in different application domains and have diverse priorities and constraints with regard to the development of applications and services. In this paper, we propose an automatic tool, SelecWeb, for selecting a web framework based on a set of criteria and developer preferences. The set of selection criteria is developed by us and is a contribution of this paper. The tool currently uses analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for comparison, analysis, and decision-making. We provide a detailed description and analysis of the tool including a case study for web framework selection. Conclusions are drawn with design ideas on future extension of the tool using machine learning.},
